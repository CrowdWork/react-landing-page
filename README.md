Project Objectives<br> 
- Reduce barriers to seed capital for early or growth stage co-ops.<br>
- Generate applied learn & earn opportunities for gig workers in the Washington, DC area.<br>
- Incentivize open cooperation in digital infrastructure development to support resilient local-first supply and value chains.<br>
<br>
Goals:<br>
- Render data from a JSON REST API endpoint into a static frontend HTML webpage template.<br>
- Define step-by-step process of cloning and replacing API endpoint source.<br>
- Map out all platform and package dependencies for the framework you chose to replicate this experiment.<br>
<br>
Other Challenge Ideas:<br>
- Use a different JavaScript framework (other than React) to render posts from this REST API endpoint. (New repo will need to be cloned.)<br>
- Extend functionality of site by adding additional endpoints.<br>
- Search and Filter posts by post categories.<br>
- Add global CSS styling to all pages.<br>
